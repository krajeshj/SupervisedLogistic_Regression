# SupervisedLogistic_Regression

The dataset of heights and weights of males and females is being used for this classification. This is loaded from a csv file.  The response label is 0 or 1. A scatter plot of heights and weights is created by gender. The dataset is split into test and training set. Accuracy is measured on the test set. Regularization parameter 'C' is tuned using a combination of cross-validation and K-fold.Finally, GridsearchCV is  used to peick the best model.
